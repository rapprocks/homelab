# homelab
Ansible and terraform configuration for an automated homelab. Goal is to be able to re-create my environment.

## Terraform
- Create files (or one file for all) for lxcs for each running container

## Ansible
- Start with a general playbook that configures the basics
    - user
    - updates
    - ssh security
    - packages
